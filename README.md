# AttentionKGDDI

Attention mechanisms have shown great promise in various natural language processing and sequence modeling tasks, and they can also be applied to healthcare-related tasks including drug-drug interaction prediction.

My master's thesis work involves implementing a drug-drug interaction prediction model using attention mechanisms.

First, we need to  extract feature vector representation of drugs from the KGs, using RDF2Vec. Then the embedded vectors are used to train the proposed attention DNN model.
